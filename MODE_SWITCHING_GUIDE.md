## API Methods (for developers)

```dart
// Toggle between modes
controller.toggleMode();

// Set specific mode
controller.setSimpleMode(true);  // Switch to simple
controller.setSimpleMode(false); // Switch to complex

// Check current mode
bool isSimple = controller.useSimpleMode;
String modeName = controller.currentModeString;
String description = controller.modeDescription;
```

## Testing

The mode switching works with all mock data scenarios:
- Clean Race (no conflicts)
- Missing Times
- Extra Times  
- Mixed Conflicts
- Complex Scenarios

Load any mock data scenario and switch between modes to see how each handles the same conflicts differently.

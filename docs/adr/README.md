# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture significant architectural decisions, their context, and consequences. Create new files as `adr/NNN-title.md` using the [template](template.md).

## When to add an ADR

- Choosing a new library or framework
- Changing sync strategy or data model
- Revising connectivity protocol or roles

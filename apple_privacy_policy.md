# Privacy Policy for XCeleration

**Effective Date:** June 4, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how XCeleration ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application ("XCeleration" or the "App").

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our application. This policy is compliant with Apple's App Store guidelines and applicable privacy laws.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide to Us

- **Race Data**: Names, bib numbers, race times, and results of race participants, manually entered by users (e.g., coaches, team members).
- **Device Connection Information**: When using multi-device synchronization features, we temporarily collect device identification information.
- **Camera Data**: With your permission, we use your device's camera for scanning QR codes. Images are processed locally and are not stored permanently unless you explicitly save them.
- **Location Information**: For race mapping and location tracking features, we collect location data with your permission.
- **Google Account Information**: When you choose to use Google Sheets features, we request access to your Google account through Google's authentication system. We only access the specific Google services needed to create and manage sheets with your race data.


## Data Storage and Protection

- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally on your device using SQLite.
- **Synchronization**: When using multi-device features, data is transmitted directly between authorized devices using peer-to-peer technology with encryption.
- **Data Transmission**: We implement industry-standard security practices, including encryption, for data transmission between devices.
- **Google Services**: When you choose to use Google Sheets features, your race data may be stored in Google's cloud services according to their terms of service and privacy policy.

## Data Sharing

- **Between Your Devices**: Race data is shared between your authorized devices when you enable synchronization.
- **With Other Users**: Data is only shared with other users (coaches, assistants) whom you explicitly authorize through the App's connection features.
- **Third Parties**: We do not sell your personal data to third parties.
- **Google Services**: When you use Google Sheets integration, your race data is shared with Google according to the permissions you grant. This sharing is governed by Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
- **Service Providers**: We may engage trusted third parties to perform services on our behalf, subject to confidentiality agreements.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect our rights.

## Your Privacy Choices and Rights

You can:
- Access and update your personal information within the App.
- Delete your data by clearing the App's data or uninstalling the App.
- Control app permissions (camera, etc.) through your device settings.

## Security

We implement appropriate technical and physical security measures, including encryption for data transmission, to protect your information. However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## Third-Party Services

Our app integrates with Google services (specifically Google Sheets and Google Drive) to provide enhanced functionality:

- **Google Authentication**: When you use Google Sheets features, you will be prompted to sign in to your Google account and grant specific permissions.
- **Terms of Service**: Your use of Google services through our app is subject to Google's Terms of Service (https://policies.google.com/terms) and Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Access Scope**: We request only the minimum permissions needed to provide the Google Sheets functionality (specifically, access to create and modify Google Sheets and related Drive files).
- **Data Handling**: Any data transferred to Google services is subject to Google's data handling practices and policies.
- **Revoking Access**: You can revoke our app's access to your Google account at any time through your Google Account settings (https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page, updating the effective date, and, where appropriate, notifying you via the App or email.

## California Privacy Rights

California residents may have additional rights regarding their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Please contact us for more information.
